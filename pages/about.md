# Our Journey So Far: A Brief Look at LTB's Development

Around 2014-2015, a few years after the creation of the CURENT research center, the center director Dr. Kevin Tomsovic initiated the idea of developing a software-based, closed-loop testbed for CURENT.
Since he was the overall director of CURENT with a super busy schedule, Dr. Tomsovic asked Dr. Fran Li to lead the development work of what is now called CURENT Large-scale Testbed (LTB) or CLTB.

In the first a couple of years of CLTB development, the team developed models of the North American power grid including WECC and reduced EI operation and planning models with various renewable energy penetration scenarios.
A nationwide HVDC overlay, inspired by the MISO HVDC overlay topology, was also created.
Meanwhile, external simulation engines were employed with in-house scripts to form a closed-loop simulation study on CLTB’s own North American models.

Around 2017, the CLTB team decided to develop our own dynamic simulation engine called ANDES to achieve flexibility of the CLTB platform.
Dr. Hantao Cui has been the lead developer of ANDES since then.
He first developed the initial version in Python and then advanced ANDES with a symbolic programming library.
Now, ANDES serves as a cornerstone package in CLTB and can be used as a standalone dynamic simulation tool as well.
Dr. Hantao Cui has been maintaining the ANDES package.
Jinning Wang joined the effort as a helper since 2021.
Around the same timeframe from 2018 to 2023, newer versions of DiME and visualizer (now called AGVis) were developed.
Several key contributors include Nick West, Nicholas Parsly, and Jinning Wang.

In spring 2023, the CLTB team was working on the development of a new package called AMS which is an economic dispatch and market simulation package.
It is designed to be integrated with ANDES to perform co-simulation of economic dispatch and dynamic simulation to form a true “digital twin” across multi-timescale.
