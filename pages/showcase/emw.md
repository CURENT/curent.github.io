### Disturbance Propagation in Power Grids With High Converter Penetration

Analytical studies based on continuum models for the 2-D power systems with synchronous generators and constant-power grid-following (GFL) converters.

respectively). (c) and (d) Continuing propagation to the diagonal node and the subsequent reflections (t=0.77 s and t=0.90 s,
respectively). (e)â€“(h) Superposition of reflection waves (t=1.05 s, t=1.20 s, t=1.35 s, and t=1.51 s, respectively)

### Transmission-and-Distribution Co-Simulation Framework

An efficient open-source transmission-and-distribution (T&D) co-simulation framework for DER frequency response based on the HELICS platform and off-the-shelf T&D simulators.
