* Disturbance Propagation in Power Grids With High Converter Penetration

Analytical studies based on continuum models for the 2-D power systems with synchronous generators and constant-power grid-following (GFL) converters.

### Transmission-and-Distribution Co-Simulation Framework

An efficient open-source transmission-and-distribution (T&D) co-simulation framework for DER frequency response based on the HELICS platform and off-the-shelf T&D simulators.
