# Abstract

Aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising technique for providing secondary frequency regulation (SFR) in highly renewable energy-penetrated power systems. Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EVâ€™s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost. More importantly, the charging time constraint can be respected in the proposed SFR provision of the EV aggregation.
