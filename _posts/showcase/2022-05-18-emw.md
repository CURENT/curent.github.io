Fig. EMW propagation in the 2-D system based on PDE. (a) and (b) Forward EMW propagation to the edges (t=0.33 s and t=0.56 s,
respectively). (c) and (d) Continuing propagation to the diagonal node and the subsequent reflections (t=0.77 s and t=0.90 s,
respectively). (e)â€“(h) Superposition of reflection waves (t=1.05 s, t=1.20 s, t=1.35 s, and t=1.51 s, respectively)
