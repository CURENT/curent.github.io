<p>ANDES is an open-source Python library for power system modeling, computation, analysis, and control. It supports power flows calculation, transient stability simulation, and small-signal stability analysis for transmission systems. ANDES implements a symbolic-numeric framework for rapid prototyping of differential-algebraic equation-based models. In this framework, a comprehensive <a href="https://docs.andes.app/en/latest/modelref.html#modelref">library of models</a> is developed, including the full second-generation renewable models. Models in ANDES have been <a href="https://docs.andes.app/en/latest/getting_started/verification.html#verification">verified</a> with commercial software.</p>

<p>ANDES is the core simulation engine for the CURENT Largescale Testbed (LTB). More information about CURENT LTB can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/CURENT/ltb2">LTB Repository</a>.</p>

<p>Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric Framework</p>

<p>Make modeling as simple as describing equations and make simulations as fast as using crafted code.</p>

<p>The design philosophy is two-fold: 1) to enable descriptive modeling using provided modeling elements and blocks, and 2) enable robust and fast numerical simulation through code generation and vectorization.</p>
