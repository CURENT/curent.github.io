# Contributing

Found a typo or inaccurate information in the documentation? Want to add a new showcase or an affiliation to the map? We have specific issue templates to help you with these contributions:

- Bug Report (including typos and inaccuracies)
- Add Showcase
- Add Affiliation to LTB Map

For other types of contributions or if you're interested in fixing a bug, please submit an issue or pull request. If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the GitHub Flow first.

For help with using the theme or general Jekyll support questions, please use the Jekyll Talk forums.

Our website is built using the Jekyll theme Minimal Mistakes. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it might not be considered. When in doubt, feel free to ask.

This also applies to author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g., `XX-fix`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.
