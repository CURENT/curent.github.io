# Abstract

The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks has made it challenging to balance the transmission system and stabilize frequency. DERs have the ability to provide frequency regulation services; however, existing frequency dynamic simulation tools—which were developed mainly for the transmission system—lack the capability to simulate distribution network dynamics with high penetrations of DERs. Although electromagnetic transient simulation tools can simulate distribution network dynamics, the computation efficiency limits their use for large-scale transmission-and-distribution (T&D) co-simulation. This paper presents an efficient open-source T&D dynamic co-simulation framework for DER frequency response based on the HELICS platform and off-the-shelf T&D simulators. The challenge of synchronizing the simulation between the transmission network and the DERs in the distribution network is solved through the detailed modeling of DERs in frequency dynamic models while DER power flow models are also preserved in the distribution networks, thereby respecting local voltage constraints when dispatching DER power for frequency response. DER frequency response (primary and secondary) is simulated in case studies to validate the proposed framework. Last, the accuracy of the proposed co-simulation model is benchmarked, and a large T&D system simulation (2k transmission and 1M distribution nodes) is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall framework.
