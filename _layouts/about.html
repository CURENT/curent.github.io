    <h2>Our Journey So Far: A Brief Look at LTB's Development</h2>
    <p>Around 2014-2015, a few years after the creation of the CURENT research center, the center
      director Dr. Kevin Tomsovic initiated the idea of developing a software-based, closed-loop testbed for CURENT.
      Since he was the overall director of CURENT with a super busy schedule, Dr. Tomsovic asked Dr. Fran Li to lead the
      development work of what is now called CURENT Large-scale Testbed (LTB) or CLTB.</p>
    <p>In the first a couple of years of CLTB development, the team developed models of the North American power grid
      including WECC and reduced EI operation and planning models with various renewable energy penetration scenarios. A
      nationwide HVDC overlay, inspired by the MISO HVDC overlay topology, was also created. Meanwhile, external simulation
      engines were employed with in-house scripts to form a closed-loop simulation study on CLTB’s own North American models.
      Also, initial versions of CLTB visualizer and data transfer package called DiME were developed and integrated into
      the CLTB platform.</p>
    <p>Around 2017, the CLTB team decided to develop our own dynamic simulation engine called ANDES to achieve flexibility
      of the CLTB platform. Dr. Hantao Cui has been the lead developer of ANDES since then. He first developed the initial
      version in Python and then advanced ANDES with a symbolic programming library. Now, ANDES serves as a cornerstone
      package in CLTB and can be used as a standalone dynamic simulation tool as well. Dr. Hantao Cui has been maintaining
      the ANDES package. Jinning Wang joined the effort as a helper since 2021.</p>
    <p>Around the same timeframe from 2018 to 2023, newer versions of DiME and visualizer (now called AGVis) were developed.
      Several key contributors include Nick West, Nicholas Parsly, and Jinning Wang.</p>
    <p>Currently, in spring 2023, the CLTB team is working on the development of a new package called AMS which is an
      economic dispatch and market simulation package. It is expected to be integrated with ANDES to perform co-simulation
      of economic dispatch and dynamic simulation to form a true “digital twin” across multi-timescale. The next version
      of CLBT will include ANDES, AMS, DiME and AGVis which is expected to be released in fall 2023.</p>
