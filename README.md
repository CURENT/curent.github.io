# CURENT LTB Web

The web is NOT hosting publicly right now!

The web is using the Jekyll Theme *Feeling Responsive*.

## Maintenance

The update should be made and tested on branch ``develop`` first, and then deployed to branch ``master`` as follow:

1. Make sure the branch ``develop`` is update to the branch ``master``
2. Update the contents in the branch ``develop``
3. Run your Jekyll site locally on branch ``develop``

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. If update looks good locally, merge the updated branch ``develop`` into branch ``master``
5. Wait the deployment of the updated website

## Content

The website contains four pages, namely, "LTB", "ANDES", "AGVis", "DiME", and "Team". The source files locate in the folder ``pages\``.

The navigation bar is configured by the file ``_data\navigation.yml``.
